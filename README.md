# What is Clima?
Clima is a user-friendly weather app that allows users to get real-time weather information for any provided location. With Clima, users can retrieve accurate information about a location's temperature and weather conditions. The app makes use of an API to gather the weather data and provides users with an easy-to-use interface that displays the information in a clear and concise manner. Once users have retrieved weather information for a location, they can save it for later viewing. Clima also supports offline mode, enabling users to view previously saved weather data without an internet connection. Overall, Clima is an excellent weather app for those looking for an easy-to-use interface and reliable weather information.

# How to use Clima?
That's easy! Simply open the application and you will be directed to the landing view where your current location's weather will be displayed IF you are connected to the internet. If you are not, the view displays the last viewed location's weather. When connected to a network you can easily toggle between two designs, search a city's weather, return to your current location and save a location's weather to your favourites... which you can easily access through the favourites button to see all you current favourites.

# To-Do?
I still have unit testing that I have to improve, I could not make the deadline for it.
